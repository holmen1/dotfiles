## LSP Troubleshooting

Having issues with language servers? Here's a step-by-step guide to diagnose and fix common problems:

### Check Installation and Status

```vim
:Mason                " Check if language servers are installed
:LspInfo              " View active language servers for current buffer
:LspLog               " Check for errors in LSP log
```

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### Language Server Not Installing

If Mason fails to install a language server:

```bash
# For Haskell Language Server, try direct installation
ghcup install hls    # Install via GHCup

# For C/C++, ensure clangd is available
sudo apt install clangd    # On Debian/Ubuntu
```

#### Language Server Not Attaching

**Force server start**
```vim
:LspStart hls      " For Haskell
:LspStart clangd   " For C/C++
```

#### Advanced LSP Commands

```vim
:LspRestart           " Restart LSP servers
:LspStop              " Stop LSP servers
:LspInstall <server>  " Install a specific server
```

This structured approach should help resolve most LSP issues while keeping your slim-vim configuration clean and functional.-----






I see you've configured HLS in your LSP setup, but it might not be loading properly. Here's how to test and fix it:

## 1. Check if HLS is Installed

First, verify HLS is properly installed via Mason:

```
:Mason
```

Look for `haskell-language-server` in the list:
- If it's marked with âœ“, it's installed
- If not, press `i` on the entry to install it

## 2. Check if HLS is Attaching to Your File

Open your Haskell file and check which LSP servers are attached:

```
:LspInfo
```

This will show all active language servers for the current buffer. If HLS is missing, that's the issue.

## 3. Test Common Issues

### Filetype Recognition

Make sure Neovim recognizes your file as Haskell:

```
:set filetype?
```

It should show `filetype=haskell`. If not, manually set it:

```
:set filetype=haskell
```

### File Extension

Ensure your file has `.hs` extension. HLS typically only attaches to files with proper extensions.

### Force LSP Attachment

Try manually starting LSP for the current buffer:

```
:LspStart hls
```

### Check Log for Errors

Look for errors in the LSP log:

```
:LspLog
```

Then add this to your LSP configuration:

```lua
hls = {
  cmd = { "haskell-language-server-wrapper", "--lsp" }
}
```
